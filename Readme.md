# Government vNext

I imagine a world. A world by the people for the people. A world where people listen, discuss, agree, disagree and ultimately can choose. Both individually and as a group. The society that lives in that world is progressive and open. The government that backs that society is adaptible. It's made to evolve freely. However is right in the current moment, facing yet unknown challenges. The rules this society makes up aren't set in stone either. They can morph with the original problems and ideas for which they got created. The existence of physical borders which are free to dynamically change is commin sense, if that is what's right during that time. That world is what I am dreaming of for so long and what I am thriving for for the rest of my life.

Governments doesn't have anything. So when they promise something they have to take it from someone else. Governments doesn't produce, they just redistribute what people produce[ยน]. There is, however, a thing that the government and the government only creates. A long-therm investment oppurtunity where a project doesn't have to show any return on investment for decades or event centuries since it's not constrained to the life time of any investors or share holders. Especially from those long therm projects society will ultimately benefit the most. A few examples would be the 1950s and 1960s space race between the USSR and US where ultimately the whole space industry was born from and supplied us with satellite imagery or offshore communications. Another example is war in general, many thechnologies sourced from it. So to takle the big problems, to go for the next frontier, the structure of companies aren't doing it anymore or we need a government which is able to discuss possible projects and investments (of money, labour, time) in the open. Especially with the society that is governmt by it.
